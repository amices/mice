  - title: "Main imputation functions"
    desc: >
      The workflow of multiple imputation is: multiply-impute the data,
      apply the complete-data model to each imputed data set, and pool
      the results to get to the final inference. The main functions
      for imputing the data are:
    contents:
      - mice
      - mice.mids
      - parlmice
  - title: "Elementary imputation functions"
    desc: >
      The elementary imputation function is the workhorse that creates
      the actual imputations. Elementary functions are called through
      the `method` argument of `mice` function.
      Each function imputes one or more columns in the data. There
      are also `mice.impute.xxx` functions outside the `mice`
      package.

  - title: "Repeated analyses and combining analytic estimates"
    desc: >
      Multiple imputation creates m > 1 completed data sets, fits
      the model of interest to each of these, and combines the
      analytic estimates. The following functions
      assist in executing the analysis and pooling steps:

      - with.mids

      - pool.r.squared

  - title: "Low-level imputation functions"
    desc: >
      Several functions are dedicated to common low-level operations
      to generate the imputations:
    contents:
      - estimice
      - norm.draw
      - .norm.draw
      - .pmm.match
  - title: "Multivariate amputation"
    desc: >
      Amputation is the inverse of imputation, starting with a
      complete dataset, and creating missing data pattern according
      to the posited missing data mechanism. Amputation is
      useful for simulation studies.
