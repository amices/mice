- title: Main imputation functions
  desc: |
    The workflow of multiple imputation is: multiply-impute the data, apply the complete-data model to each imputed data set, and pool the results to get to the final inference. The main functions for imputing the data are:
  contents:
  - mice
  - mice.mids
  - parlmice
  - futuremice
- title: Elementary imputation functions
  desc: |
    The elementary imputation function is the workhorse that creates the actual imputations. Elementary functions are called through the `method` argument of `mice` function. Each function imputes one or more columns in the data. There are also `mice.impute.xxx` functions outside the `mice` package.

- title: Plots comparing observed to imputed/amputed data
  desc: |
    These plots contrast the observed data with the imputed/amputed data, usually with a blue/red distinction.

  - bwplot.mids
  - densityplot.mids
  - plot.mids
  - stripplot.mids
  - xyplot.mids
- title: Repeated analyses and combining analytic estimates
  desc: |
    Multiple imputation creates m > 1 completed data sets, fits the model of interest to each of these, and combines the analytic estimates. The following functions assist in executing the analysis and pooling steps:
  contents:
  - with.mids
  - pool
  - pool.r.squared
  - pool.scalar
  - pool.table
  - nelsonaalen
  - pool.compare
  - anova.mira
  - fix.coef
  - D1
  - D2
  - D3
- title: Data manipulation
  desc: |
    The multiply-imputed data can be combined in various ways, and exported into other formats.
  contents:
  - complete
  - cbind
  - rbind
  - ibind
  - as.mids
  - as.mira
  - as.mitml.result
  - filter.mids
  - mids2mplus
  - mids2spss
- title: Class descriptions
  desc: |
    The data created at the various analytic phases are stored as list objects of a specific class. The most important classes and class-test functions are:
  contents:
  - mids-class
  - mira-class
  - is.mids
  - is.mipo
  - is.mira
  - is.mitml.result
- title: Extraction functions
  desc: |
    Helpers to extract and print information from objects of specific classes.

- title: Low-level imputation functions
  desc: |
    Several functions are dedicated to common low-level operations to generate the imputations:
  contents:
  - estimice
  - norm.draw
  - .norm.draw
  - .pmm.match
- title: Multivariate amputation
  desc: |
    Amputation is the inverse of imputation, starting with a complete dataset, and creating missing data pattern according to the posited missing data mechanism. Amputation is useful for simulation studies.
