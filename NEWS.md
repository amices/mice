# mice 3.16.5

### Bug fixes

* Patches a bug in `complete()` that auto-repeated imputed values into cells that should NOT be imputed (occurred as a special case of `rbind()`, where the first set of rows was imputed and the second was not).
* Replaces the internal variable `type` by the more informative `pred` (currently active row of `predictorMatrix`)

# mice 3.16.4

### Major changes

* **Imputing categorical data by predictive mean matching**. Predictive mean matching (PMM) is the default method of `mice()` for imputing numerical variables, but it has long been possible to impute factors. This enhancement introduces better support to work with categorical variables in PMM. The **former system** translated factors into integers by `ynum <- as.integer(f)`. However, the order of integers in `ynum` may have no sensible interpretation for an unordered factor. The **new system** quantifies `ynum` and could yield better results because of higher $R^2$. The method calculates the canonical correlation between `y` (as dummy matrix) and a linear combination of imputation model predictors `x`. The algorithm then replaces each category of `y` by a single number taken from the first canonical variate. After this step, the imputation model is fitted, and the predicted values from that model are extracted to function as the similarity measure for the matching step.

* The method works for both ordered and unordered factors. No special precautions are taken to ensure monotonicity between the category numbers and the quantifications, so the method should be able to preserve quadratic and other non-monotone relations of the predicted metric. It may be beneficial to remove very sparsely filled categories, for which there is a new `trim` argument. All you have to use the new technique is specify to `mice(..., method = "pmm", ...)`. Both numerical and categorical variables will then be imputed by PMM.

* Potential advantages are:
  - Simpler and faster than fitting a generalised linear model, e.g., logistic regression or the proportional odds model;
  - Should be insensitive to the order of categories;
  - No need to solve problems with perfect prediction;
  - Should inherit the good statistical properties of predictive mean matching.

* Note that we still lack solid evidence for these claims. (#576). Contributed @stefvanbuuren

# mice 3.16.3

### Major changes

* **New system-independent method for pooling**: This version introduces a new function `pool.table()` that takes a tidy table of parameter estimates stemming from `m` repeated analyses. The input data must consist of three columns (parameter name, estimate, standard error) and a specification of the degrees of freedom of the model fitted to the complete data. The `pool.table()` function outputs 14 pooled statistics in a tidy form. The primary use of `pool.table()` is to support parameter pooling for techiques that have no `tidy()` or `glance()` methods, either within `R` or outside `R`. The `pool.table()` function also allows for a novel workflows that 1) break apart the traditional `pool()` function into a data-wrangling part and a parameters-reducing part, and 2) does not necessarily depend on classed R objects. (#574). Contributed @stefvanbuuren

### Bug fixes

* Fixes the "large logo" problem. (#574). Contributed @hanneoberman

# mice 3.16.2

### Major changes

* **Breaking change:** The `complete(..., action = "long", ...)` command puts the columns named `".imp"` and `".id"` in the last two positions of the long data (instead of first two positions).  In this way, the columns of the imputed data will have the same positions as in the original data, which is more user-friendly and easier to work with. Note that any existing code that assumes that variables `".imp"` and `".id"` are in columns 1 and 2 will need to be modified. The advice is to modify the code using the variable names `".imp"` and `".id"`. If you want the old behaviour, specify the argument `order = "first"`. (#569). Contributed @stefvanbuuren

# mice 3.16.1

### Minor changes

* Adds support for the `dots` argument to `ranger::ranger(...)` in `mice.impute.rf()` (#563). Contributed @edbonneville

# mice 3.16.0

### Major changes

# mice 3.15.0

### Major changes

* Adds a function `futuremice()` with support for parallel imputation using the `future` package (#504). Contributed @thomvolker, @gerkovink

* Adds multivariate predictive mean matching `mice.impute.mpmm()`. (#460). Contributed @Mingyang-Cai

* Adds `convergence()` for convergence evaluation (#484). Contributed @hanneoberman

* Reverts the internal seed behaviour back to `mice 3.13.10` (#515). #432 introduced new local seed in response to #426. However, various issues arose with this facility (#459, #492, #502, #505). This version restores the old behaviour using global `.Random.seed`. Contributed @gerkovink 

* Adds a `custom.t` argument to `pool()` that allows the advanced user to specify a custom rule for calculating the total variance $T$. Contributed @gerkovink

* Adds new argument `exclude` to `mice.impute.pmm()` that excludes a user-specified vector of values from matching. Excluded values will not appear in the imputations. Since the observed values are not imputed, the user-specified values are still being used to fit the imputation model (#392, #519). Contributed @gerkovink

### Minor changes

* Styles all `.R` and `.Rmd` files
* Makes post-processing assignment consistent with lines 85/86 in `sampler.R` (#511)
* Edit test broken on R<4 (#501). Contributed @MichaelChirico

* Repairs capitalisation problems with `lastSeedValue` variable name
* Solves `x$lastSeedValue` problem in `cbind.mids()` (#502)
* Fixes problems with `ampute()`
* Preserves stochastic nature of `mice()` by smarter random seed initialisation (#459)
* Repairs a `drop = FALSE` buglet in `mice.impute.rf()` (#447, #448)
* @str-amg reported that the new dependency on `withr` package should have version 2.4.0  (published in January 2021) or higher. Versions `withr 2.3.0` and before may give `Error: object 'local_seed' is not exported by 'namespace:withr'`. Either update manually, or install the patched version `mice 3.14.1` from GitHub. (#445). NOTE: `withr` is no longer needed in `mice 3.15.0`

# mice 3.14.0

### Major changes

* Adds four new univariate functions using the lasso for automatic variable selection. Contributed by @EdoardoCostantini (#438). 

  - `mice.impute.lasso.norm()` for lasso linear regression
  - `mice.impute.lasso.logreg()` for lasso logistic regression
  - `mice.impute.lasso.select.norm()` for lasso selector + linear regression
  - `mice.impute.lasso.select.logreg()` for lasso selector + logistic regression

* Adds Jamshidian && Jalal's non-parametric MCAR test, `mice::MCAR()` and associated plot method. Contributed by @cjvanlissa (#423).

* Adds two new functions `pool.syn()` and `pool.scalar.syn()` that specialise pooling estimates from synthetic data. The `"reiter2003"` pooling rule assumes that synthetic data were created from complete data. Thanks Thom Volker (#436).

* By default, `mice.impute.rf()` now uses the faster `ranger` package as back-end instead of `randomForest` package. If you want the old behaviour specify the `rfPackage = "randomForest"` argument to the `mice(...)` call. Contributed @prockenschaub (#431).

### Minor changes

* Avoids changing the global `.Random.seed` (#426, #432) by implementing `withr::local_preserve_seed()` and `withr::local_seed()`. This change provides stabler behavior in complex scripts. The change does not appear to break reproducibility when `mice()` was run with a seed. Nevertheless, if you run into a reproducibility problem, install `mice 3.13.12` or before.
* Improves the imputation of parabolic data in `mice.impute.quadratic()`, adds a parameter `quad.outcome` containing the name of the outcome variable in the complete-data model. Contributed @Mingyang-Cai, @gerkovink (#408)
* Generalises `pool()` so that it processes the parameters from all `gamlss` sub-models. Thanks Marcio Augusto Diniz (#406, #405)

* Repairs an error in the `mice:::barnard.rubin()` function for infinite `dfcom`. Thanks @huftis (#441).
* Solves problem with `Xi <- as.matrix(...)` in `mice.impute.2l.lmer()` that occurred when a cluster contains only one observation (#384)

* Reverts `with.mids()` function to old version because the change in commit 4634094 broke downstream package `metafor` (#292)
* Solves a glitch in `mice.impute.rf()` in finding candidate donors (#288, #289)

# mice 3.12.0

### Major changes

* **Much faster predictive mean matching**. The new `matchindex` C function makes predictive mean matching **50 to 600 times faster**. 
The speed of `pmm` is now on par with normal imputation (`mice.impute.norm()`)
and with the `miceFast` package, without compromising on the statistical quality of 
the imputations. Thanks to Polkas <https://github.com/Polkas/miceFast/issues/10> and 
suggestions by Alexander Robitzsch. See #236 for more details.

* **New `ignore` argument to `mice()`**. This argument is a logical vector 
of `nrow(data)` elements indicating which rows are ignored when creating 
the imputation model. We may use the `ignore` argument to split the data 
into a training set (on which the imputation model is built) and a test 
set (that does not influence the imputation model estimates). The argument
is based on the suggestion in 
<https://github.com/amices/mice/issues/32#issuecomment-355600365>. See #32 for 
more background and techniques. Crafted by Patrick Rockenschaub

* **New `filter()` function for `mids` objects**. New `filter()` method that 
subsets a `mids` object (multiply-imputed data set).
The method accepts a logical vector of length `nrow(data)`, or an expression
to construct such a vector from the incomplete data. (#269). 
Crafted by Patrick Rockenschaub.

* **Breaking change:** The `matcher` algorithm in `pmm` has changed to `matchindex`
for speed improvements. If you want the old behavior, specify `mice(..., use.matcher = TRUE)`.

### Minor changes

* Corrected installation problem related to `cpp11` package (#286)
* Simplifies `with.mids()` by calling `eval_tidy()` on a quosure. Does not yet solve #265.
* Improve documentation for `pool()` and `pool.scalar()` (#142, #106, #190 and others)
* Makes `tidy.mipo` more flexible (#276)
* Solves a problem if `nelsonaalen()` gets a `tibble` (#272)
* Add explanation to how `NA`s can appear in the imputed data (#267)
* Add warning to `quickpred()` documentation (#268)
* Styles all sources files with styler
* Improves consistency in code and documentation
* Moves internally defined functions to global namespace
* Solves bug in internal `sum.scores()`
* Adds deprecated messages to `lm.mids()`, `glm.mids()`, `pool.compare()`
* Removes `.pmm.match()` and `expandcov()`
* Strips out all `return()` calls placed just before end-of-function
* Remove all trailing spaces
* Repairs a bug in the routine for finding the `printFlag` value (#258)
* Update URL's after transfer to organisation `amices`

# mice 3.11.0

### Major changes

* The Cox model does not return `df.residual`, which caused problematic behavior in the `D1()`, `D2()`, `D3()`, `anova()` and `pool()`. `mice` now extracts the relevant information from other parts of the objects returned by `survival::coxph()`, which solves long-standing issues with the integration of the Cox model (#246).

### Minor changes

* Adds missing `Rccp` dependency to work with `tidyr 1.1.1` (#248).
* Addresses warnings: `Non-file package-anchored link(s) in documentation object`.
* Updates on `ampute` documentation (#251).
* Ask user permission before installing a package from `suggests`.

# mice 3.10.0

### Major changes

* New functions `tidy.mipo()` and `glance.mipo()` return standardized output that conforms to `broom` specifications. Kindly contributed by Vincent Arel Bundock (#240).

### Minor changes

* Solves a problem with the `D3` testing script that produced an error on CRAN (#244).

# mice 3.9.0

### Major changes

* The `D3()` function in `mice` gave incorrect results. This version solves a problem in the calculation of the `D3`-statistic. See #226 and #228 for more details. The documentation explains why results from `mice::D3()` and `mitml::testModels()` may differ.

* The `pool()` function is now more forgiving when there is no `glance()` function (#233)

* It is possible to bypass `remove.lindep()` by setting `eps = 0` (#225)

### Minor changes

* Adds reference to Leacy's thesis
* Adds an example to the `plot.mids()` documentation

# mice 3.8.0

### Major changes 

* This version adds two new NARFCS methods for imputing data under the *Missing Not at Random (MNAR)* assumption. NARFCS is generalised version of the so-called $\delta$-adjustment method. Margarita Moreno-Betancur and Ian White kindly contributes the functions `mice.impute.mnar.norm()` and `mice.impute.mnar.logreg()`. These functions aid in performing sensitivity analysis to investigate the impact of different MNAR assumptions on the conclusion of the study. An alternative for MNAR is the older `mice.impute.ri()` function.

* Installation of `mice` is faster. External packages needed for imputation and analyses are now installed on demand. The number of dependencies as estimated by `rsconnect::appDepencies()` decreased from 132 to 83.

* The name clash with the `complete()` function of `tidyr` should no longer be a problem.

* There is now a more flexible `pool()` function that integrates better with the `broom` and `broom.mixed` packages.

### Bug fixes

* Deprecates `pool.compare()`. Use `D1()` instead (#220)
* Removes everything in `utils::globalVariables()`
* Prevents name clashes with `tidyr` by defining `complete.mids()` as an S3 method for the `tidyr::complete()` generic (#212)
* Extends the `pool()` function to deal with multiple sets of parameters. Currently supported keywords are: `term` (all `broom` functions), `component` (some `broom.mixed` functions) and `y.values` (for `multinom()` model) (#219)
* Adds a new `install.on.demand()` function for lighter installation
* Adds `toenail2` and remove dependency on `HSAUR3`
* Solves problem with `ampute` in extreme cases (#216)
* Solves problem with `pool` with `mgcv::gam` (#218)
* Adds `.gitattributes` for consistent line endings

* Solves a bug that crashed `mids2spss()`, thanks Edgar Schoreit (#149)
* Solves a problem in the routing logic (#149) causing that passive 
imputation was not done when no predictors were specified. No passive
imputation correctly will ignore any the specification of 
`predictorMatrix`.
* Implements an alternative solution for #93 and #96. Instead of skipping 
imputation of variables without predictors, `mice 3.3.1` will impute 
those variables using the intercept only
* Adds a routine contributed by Simon Grund that checks for deprecated 
arguments #137
* Improves the `nelsonaalen()` function for data where variables 
`time` or `status` have already been defined (#140), thanks matthieu-faron

# mice 3.0.0 
         
Version 3.0 represents a major update that implements the 
following features: 

1. `blocks`: The main algorithm iterates over blocks. A block is
    simply a collection of variables. In the common MICE algorithm each 
    block was equivalent to one variable, which - of course - is 
    the default; The `blocks` argument allows mixing univariate 
    imputation method multivariate imputation methods. The `blocks` 
    feature bridges two seemingly disparate approaches, joint modeling 
    and fully conditional specification, into one framework;

2. `where`: The `where` argument is a logical matrix of the same size 
    of `data` that specifies which cells should be imputed. This opens 
    up some new analytic possibilities;
    
3.  Multivariate tests: There are new functions `D1()`, `D2()`, `D3()`
    and `anova()` that perform multivariate parameter tests on the 
    repeated analysis from on multiply-imputed data;

4. `formulas`: The old `form` argument has been redesign and is now 
    renamed to `formulas`. This provides an alternative way to specify
    imputation models that exploits the full power of R's native 
    formula's. 

5.  Better integration with the `tidyverse` framework, especially 
    for packages `dplyr`, `tibble` and  `broom`;
   
6.  Improved numerical algorithms for low-level imputation function. 
    Better handling of duplicate variables.

7.  Last but not least: A brand new edition AND online version of
    [Flexible Imputation of Missing Data. Second Edition.](https://stefvanbuuren.name/fimd/)
