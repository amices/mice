We present a method to accurately evaluate the effect of missing data on statistical inferences. R-function `ampute` is an easy-to-use implementation of a multivariate missing data generation procedure. With `ampute`, it is straightforward to generate missing values in multiple variables, with different missing data proportions and varying underlying missingness mechanisms. 

`ampute` is especially useful for the evaluation of missing data methods, but can also be used for the creation of planned missing data designs, for examination of the effect of measurement error on statistical inferences and for research in the field of multiple source data. 

In general, a missing data methodology is evaluated by means of simulations. Such simulation studies generally have four steps: 

1) A multivariate, complete data set is simulated and considered the population of interest. 
2) This data set is then made incomplete. 
3) The incomplete data are estimated by means of the missing data method. 
4) Statistical inferences are obtained for the original, complete data set and after dealing with the missing values. A comparison of these inferences gives an indication of the performance of the missing data method. 

An important aspect of these studies is the generation of missing values in a simulated, complete data set: the amputation procedure.

We demonstrate the performance of `ampute` and its improvement over the current amputation practice in our article *Generating missing values for simulation purposes: A multivariate amputation procedure*. In this article, we describe that the current amputation practice may not be appropriate for the generation of intuitive and reliable missing data problems. That is to say, important missing data characteristics such as the missingness percentage and the impact on statistical estimates influence each other. On the other hand, we demonstrate that the multivariate amputation procedure generates reliable amputations and allows for a proper regulation of missing data problems. The procedure has additional features to generate any missing data scenario precisely as intended. Hence, the multivariate amputation procedure is an efficient method to accurately evaluate missing data methodology.

`ampute` is available in multiple imputation package **mice**. 

In this vignette we will:

1) give a concise summary of the missing data generation procedure
2) explain how to use `ampute` to make sophisticated missingness
3) discuss some additional features of `ampute` 

### 1. The multivariate amputation procedure

The multivariate amputation procedure of `ampute` is built upon an initial idea proposed by Brand (1999). Figure 1 shows a schematic overview of the resulting amputation procedure. The method requires a complete dataset of $n$ participants and $m$ variables. The result of the procedure consists of multiple subsets with either incomplete or complete data. These subsets are merged to obtain an incomplete version of the original dataset. 

```{r, out.width=700, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/Scheme.png", auto_pdf = TRUE, dpi=600)
```

The amputation procedure starts with the user deciding what kinds of missing data patterns he desires to establish. A missing data pattern is a particular combination of variables with missing values and variables remaining complete. Based on the number of missing data patterns $k$,the complete dataset is randomly divided into $k$ subsets. The size of these subsets may differ between the patterns. 

For MCAR missingnes, the next step involves the specification of the missingness proportion. For MAR and MNAR missingness, we calculate so-called weighted sum scores. A weighted sum score is simply the outcome of a linear regression equation where the coefficients are determined by the user. Based on the coefficients (i.e. weights) and a candidate's variable value, each candidate obtains a different weighted sum score. Every variable may or may not play a role in this calculation.

The third step of the procedure comprehends the allocation of probabilities. For MCAR missingness, this probability is fixed and is determined by the missingness proportion. For MAR and MNAR missingness, a candidate obtains a probability of being missing based on his weighted sum score. The relation between the weighted sum scores and the probabilities are determined by one of four possible logistic distribution functions. For instance, cases with high weighted sum scores might have a higher probability of being missing than cases with low weighted sum scores. 
In the end, the allocated probabilities are executed. As a result, the candidates are divided into two groups: one group will receive the missing data pattern of its candidacy while the other group remains complete. Logically, the number of candidates who will receive missing values depends on the desired missingness proportion.  

Although all these steps are connected, `ampute` provides a way to vary the missing data generation procedure without influencing other parameters. Therefore we developed `ampute` such that each step of the procedure can be manipulated with one of the function's arguments. Figure 2 shows the most important arguments. 

```{r, out.width = 700, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/Flowchart.png", auto_pdf = TRUE, dpi=600)
```

### 2. `ampute`'s arguments

`ampute` contains several arguments to manipulate the features of the generated missing dat problem. We will now continue with a more thorough explanation of each of the arguments from Figure 2. In short, the arguments are used for the following: 
1) data: feed function complete data 
2) prop: define missingness proportion
3) patterns: specify missing data patterns 
4) freq: specify relative occurrence of these patterns
5) mech: choose between MCAR, MAR and MNAR mechanisms
6) weights: specify weights for calculation of weighted sum scores
7) type: choose RIGHT, MID, TAIL or LEFT logistic distribution function

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
require("mice")
```

#### 2.1 Data

The first argument is an input argument for a complete dataset. In simulation settings, multivariate data can be generated by using function `mvrnorm` from R-package **MASS**. Be aware that the covariance matrix should be semi definite. 

```{r}
set.seed(2016)
testdata <- MASS::mvrnorm(n = 10000, mu = c(10, 5, 0), Sigma = matrix(data = c(1.0, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 1.0, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 1.0), nrow = 3, byrow = T))
testdata <- as.data.frame(testdata)
summary(testdata)
```

The amputation procedure can immediately be executed when this dataset is entered into the function. Storing the result allows you to work with the amputed data. 

```{r}
result <- ampute(testdata)
result
```

The incomplete dataset is stored under `amp`. To see whether the amputation has gone according plan, a quick investigation can be done by using function `md.pattern`.

```{r}
md.pattern(result$amp)
```

The rows of the table show the different missing data patterns with the number of cases accordingly. The first row always refers to the complete cases. The last column contains the number of variables with missing values in that specific pattern. Consequently, each column total describes the number of cells with missing values for that variable. A more thorough explanation of `md.pattern` can be found in its help file (`?md.pattern`). Note that because `md.pattern` sorts the columns in increasing amounts of missing information, the order of the variables is different from the order in the data. 

#### 2.2 Prop

The first step in generating a missing data problem in complete data is always the specification of the missingness proportion. In `ampute`, we call this argument `prop`. As a default, the missingness proportion is 0.5: 

```{r}
result$prop
```

This means that 50% of the cases will have missing values. It is easy to change this proportion by using the argument `prop`. One might also want to specify the percentage of missing cells. For this, the argument `bycases` should be `FALSE`. 

```{r}
result <- ampute(testdata, prop = 0.2, bycases = FALSE)
md.pattern(result$amp)
``` 

An inspection of the result shows that the proportion of missing cells is approximately 20%, as requested (the data set contains 10000 * 3 = 30000 cells, in total, 6425 cells are made missing). `ampute` automatically calculates how these 6000 missing cells are divided among the patterns. As a result, the proportion of missing cases is: 

```{r}
result$prop
```

#### 2.3 Patterns

The basic idea of `ampute` is the generation of missingness patterns. Each pattern is a combination of missingness on specific variables while other variables remain complete. For example, someone could have forgotten the last page of a questionnaire, resulting in missingness on a specific set of questions. Another missingness pattern could occur when someone is not willing to answer private questions. Or when a participant misses a wave in a longitudinal study. In other words, each pattern is a specific combination of missing and complete variables. 

The default missingness patterns can by obtained by:  

```{r}
mypatterns <- result$patterns
mypatterns
```

In the `patterns` matrix, each row refers to a missing data pattern and each column to a variable. `0` is used for variables that should have missing values in a particular pattern. `1` is used otherwise. Here, three missing data patterns are specified with missing values on one variable only. Note that as a result of this, none of the cases will have missingness on more than one variable. A case either has missingness on V1, V2 or V3 or remains complete.  

It is possible to manipulate the matrix by changing the values or adding rows. For example, we can change the missingness patterns as follows:

```{r}
mypatterns[2, 1] <- 0
mypatterns <- rbind(mypatterns, c(0, 1, 0))
mypatterns
```

By doing this, we create a missingness pattern where cases will have missingness on V1 and V2 but not on V3 (pattern 2). Also, I have added a fourth missing data pattern to create a combinaton of missingness on V1 and V3. 

Now, I can perform the amputation again with the desired patterns matrix as its third argument. Inspect the result with the `md.pattern` function. 

```{r}
result <- ampute(testdata, patterns = mypatterns)
md.pattern(result$amp)
```

#### 2.4 Freq

The function `ampute` works by dividing the complete dataset into multiple subsets. The number of these subsets is determined by the number of patterns because all cases are divided over the subsets. As such, they become candidate for a certain missing data pattern. 

The size of the subsets, and thereby the relative occurrence of the missing data pattern, can be determined with argument `freq`. This argument is a vector with values between 0 and 1. The number of values determines the number of subsets and must be equal to the number of patterns. The values themselves are interpreted relatively from each other. 

For example, 

```{r}
result$freq
```

this frequency vector has four values of equal size. This means that four subsets with equal size are created. We can adapt the frequency vector such that subset one becomes much larger than the other subsets. For example:

```{r}
myfreq <- c(0.7, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1)
```

Note that the sum of the frequency values should always be 1 in order to divide all the cases over the subsets. 

```{r}
result <- ampute(testdata, freq = myfreq, patterns = mypatterns)
md.pattern(result$amp)
```

With `md.pattern` we can check whether the frequency specifications are performed as intended. It turns out there are indeed four missing data patterns with the first pattern occuring seven times as often as the other three patterns. 

#### 2.5 Mech

At this point, we have to decide which kind of missingness mechanism we are going to implement. For more information about missingness mechanisms, I refer to Van Buuren (2012), but in short, we distinguish MCAR, MAR and MNAR missingness. With MCAR missingness, the missing values are implemented completely at random. With MAR missingness, the missingness depends on the values of observed variables. With MNAR missingness, the missingness depends on the missing values themselves. 

Now, `ampute`'s argument `mech` is a string which needs either `"MCAR"`, `"MAR"` or `"MNAR"`. For MCAR missingness, only the argument `prop` needs another specification (or you can leave it at the default). With MAR and MNAR missingness, the arguments `weights` and `type` can be used to manipulate the characteristics of the missing data problem. 

As a default `mech == "MAR"`: 

```{r}
result$mech
```

#### 2.6 Weights

With this argument, we can determine how the values in the dataset are related to whether they become missing or not. After specifying the so-called `weights` matrix, we calculate a weighted sum score for each candidate. Before we explain how this calculation takes place, it is important to know that we will use the weighted sum scores to determine whether a case receives missing values or not. Namely, based on his weighted sum score, each candidate obtains a probability of being missing. For the allocation of these probabilities, we use logistic distribution functions. We will discuss these distributions function in part 2.6 of this vignette: `type`. Basically, the idea is that, for instance, cases with high weighted sum scores will have a higher probability of being missing than cases with low weighted sum scores. 

The weighted sum scores are built from the variable values and certain pre-specified weights. In fact, a weighted sum score is simply the outcome of a linear regression equation where the coefficients are determined by us. Thus, the weighted sum score of case $i$ is calculated as follows: 

\begin{equation*}
wss_i = w_1 \cdot y_{1i} + w_2 \cdot y_{2i} + ... + w_m \cdot y_{mi},
\end{equation*}

\noindent where $\{y_{1i}, y_{2i}, ..., y_{mi}\}$ is the set of variable values of case $i$ and $\{w_1, w_2, ..., w_m\}$ are the corresponding pre-specified weights. For our example, $j\in\{1, 2, 3\}$ and $k\in\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ because there are three variables and four missing data patterns. 

For every pattern we can set one weight for every variable to govern the impact of the variables on the formation of the sum score. Variables with higher weights will have a larger influence on the size of the weighted sum score than variables with lower weights. For instance, if variables V1 and V2 have weight values 4 and 2 respectively, V1's importance is twice as large as that of V2. Note that the influence of the weights is relative; in the example above, weight values of 0.4 and 0.2 would have an equivalent effect on the calculation of the weighted sum scores. The sign of the weight values influences whether a weighted sum score increases or decreases. Namely, a positive weight will increase the weighted sum score while a negative weight will have a decreasing impact. Furthermore, each pattern can obtain its own weight values. For example, variable V1 can have a weight value of 4 in the first pattern, but a weight value of -2 in the second pattern.

All the weights values are stored and used in R-function `ampute` by means of the `weights` matrix. This matrix has dimensions #patterns by #variables. The default `weights` matrix with a MAR missingness mechanism is as follows: 

```{r}
result$weights
```

Since we have four patterns, the `weights` matrix also contains four rows. Each of these rows contains a weight for every variable. In this situation, only weight values of 0 and 1 are used. This means that some variables are non-weighted. The variables that are weighted, are of equal importance (since they all have value 1). 
Of course, the idea of the `weights` matrix is to weight variables differently from each other. For instance, we can give variable V2 a higher weight than variable V3: 
```{r}
myweights <- result$weights
myweights[1, ] <- c(0, 0.8, 0.4)
```

By choosing the values 0.8 and 0.4, variable V2 is weighted twice as heavy as variable V3. For pattern 3, we will weight variable V1 three times as heavy as variable V2. 

```{r}
myweights[3, ] <- c(3, 1, 0)
myweights
```

Before we continue to apply these weights, we must remark that an important feature of the multivariate amputation procedure is situated in the possibility to choose a weight value of zero. A zero weight indicates that the values of that variable play no role in the calculation of the weighted sum scores. Since the probabilities of being missing are based on the weighted sum scores, non-weighted variables will become independent in the process of determining which cases will obtain missing values. Since, by definition, MAR missingness means that the probability of being missing depends on the values of observed variables, we can generate a MAR missingness mechanism by assigning zero weights to all variables that will be amputed. In contrast, if we desire to give a non-zero weight to one or more of the variables that will be amputed, the generated missingness mechanism is MNAR.  

This effect is easy to see if you compare the default `weights` matrix with our `patterns` matrix in situation of a MNAR missingness mechanism. 

```{r}
result <- ampute(testdata, freq = myfreq, patterns = mypatterns, mech = "MNAR")
result$patterns
result$weights
```

In the `patterns` matrix, the variables that will be amputed are coded with `0`. In the `weights` matrix, these exact same variables are weighted with `1`. Apparently, the variables that will be made incomplete are determining which cases will be made missing. With MAR missingness, this is exactly opposite. Of course, if you create your own `weights` matrix, you can make nice variants and combinations of MAR and MNAR missingness. 

We will now apply our `patterns` and `weights` matrices and inspect the results in two ways: boxplots and scatterplots.   

```{r}
result <- ampute(testdata, freq = myfreq, patterns = mypatterns, weights = myweights)
```

##### Boxplots

Within pacakge **mice**, we developed function `bwplot` to easily see the distributions of the amputed and non-amputed data. This plot function might be useful because the boxplots show the relation between the missingness and the variables values. 

With function `bwplot`, argument `which.pat` can be used to specify the patterns you are interested in (default: all patterns). The argument `yvar` should contain the variables names (default: all variables). Besides, the function returns the mean, variance and $n$ of the amputed and non-amputed data for each variable and each pattern requested. In the column `Amp`, a `1` refers to the amputed data and `0` to the non-amputed data. If descriptives are not required, the argument `descriptives` can be set to `FALSE`. 

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
lattice::bwplot(result, which.pat = c(1, 3), descriptives = TRUE)
```

The medians and boundaries of the boxes show that in pattern 1, the amputed data are shifted to the right with respect to the non-amputed data. For variable V2, this effect is the largest, due to the weight value that was specified (0.8). For V1, there is a very small difference between the boxplots of the amputed and non-amputed data. This makes sense, because variable V1 was amputed in the first pattern and therefore set to `0` in the `weights` matrix. The small difference that is visible is due to the positive correlation between V1 on the one side and V2 and V3 on the other side. These correlations were created during the simulation of the data. 

If desired, one could use the function `tsum.test()` from package `BSDA` to perform a t-test on the amputed and non-amputed data. The data returned in the descriptives table can be used for that. For example, to know whether the mean difference between the amputed and non-amputed data for variable V2 in pattern 1 is significant, one could run:

```{r, include = FALSE}
require(BSDA)
```

```{r}
BSDA::tsum.test(mean.x = 0.39077, mean.y = -0.38992, s.x = sqrt(0.83774), s.y = sqrt(0.87721), n.x = 3473, n.y = 3493)
```

As is visible, there is a significant difference between the amputed and non-amputed data of variable V2 in pattern 1. For pattern 3, the difference between the distributions of the amputed and non-amputed data is largest for variable V1, as can be expected due to the weight values in pattern 3. 

##### Scatterplots

Scatterplots also help to investigate the effect of the specifications. We can directly impose the function `xyplot` on the `mads` object. The function contains arguments comparable to `bwplot`. For example, we can investigate the weighted sum scores of pattern 1 as follows:

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
lattice::xyplot(result, which.pat = 1)
```

The scatterplots show that there is a very small relation between V1 and the weighted sum scores. Furthermore, the relation between V2 and the weighted sum scores is very strong, meaning that a case's value on V2 is very important in the generation of the weighted sum score. Actually, this is what causes the differences between the amputed and non-amputed data in the boxplots above. For V3 and the weighted sum scores, the relation is a bit weaker than for V2 but more present than for V1. 

#### 2.7 Type

As said before, each candidate obtains a probability based on his weighted sum score. For the relation between the weighted sum scores and the probabilities we can take two approaches. First, we can use one or more of four logistic distribution functions as shown in Figure 3. Second, we can specify the probability distributions manually by means of so-called odds values. 

To distinguish between these two approaches, `ampute` contains an extra argument: `cont` which can be set to `TRUE`, indicating that continuous distributions functions are used, or to `FALSE`, indicating that the probabilities will be specified manually. 

### `cont == TRUE`

When argument `cont` is set to `TRUE`, we use argument `type` to choose between the four logistic distribution functions. Figure 3 shows these four types.  

```{r, include = FALSE}

logistic <- function(x){
  exp(x)/(1+exp(x))
} 
x1 <- seq(-3, 3, 0.01)
y1 <- logistic(-mean(x1)+x1[])
data2 <- as.data.frame(matrix(c(x1, y1), 601, 2))
names(data2) <- c("X1", "Y")
data2[602:1202, "X1"] <- x1
data2[602:1202, "Y"] <- logistic(-abs(x1[]-mean(x1))+0.75)
data2[1203:1803, "X1"] <- x1
data2[1203:1803, "Y"] <- logistic(abs(x1[]-mean(x1))-0.75)
data2[1804:2404, "X1"] <- x1
data2[1804:2404, "Y"] <- logistic(mean(x1)-x1[])
data2["Type"] <- c(rep("RIGHT", 601), rep("MID", 601), rep("TAIL", 601), rep("LEFT", 601))
plot1 <- xyplot(Y ~ X1, data2, group = Type, t = 'l', 
                lty=c(1,2,3,4), 
                cex = 0.5, col = rep("black", 4),
                xlab = "Standardized weighted sum scores", 
                ylab = "Probability",
                key=list(space="top", columns=4, lines = list(lty = c(1, 2, 3, 4)), text = list(c("LEFT", "MID", "RIGHT", "TAIL"))))
```

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5, echo = FALSE}
plot1
```

In `ampute`, the logistic distribution functions are applied to the weighted sum scores. For instance, in the situation of RIGHT missingness, cases with high weighted sum scores will have a higher probability to have missing values, compared to cases with low weighted sum scores. With a left-tailed (LEFT), centered (MID) or both-tailed (TAIL) missingness type, higher probability values are given to the candidates with low, average or extreme weighted sum scores respectively.

For each pattern, a different missingness type can be chosen. In our example, we have four patterns, so four type specifications are required. It is advised to inspect the result with `bwplot` (below, this is done for pattern 2), although the scatterplots give insight as well (as an example, we show a plot for pattern 4).

```{r}
result <- ampute(testdata, freq = c(0.7, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1), patterns = mypatterns, weights = myweights, cont = TRUE, type = c("RIGHT", "TAIL", "MID", "LEFT"))
```

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
bwplot(result, which.pat = 2, descriptives = FALSE)
```

From the boxplots of pattern 2, it becomes visible that the interquartile range (IQR) is much larger for the amputed V3 values compared to the non-amputed data. This is due to the fact that in pattern 2 only V3 defines the missingness. Besides, we requested a TAIL missingness type, which means that all cases with values at the tails of the distribution of the weighted sum scores (based on merely V3), will be made missing.

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
xyplot(result, which.pat = 4)
```

First, notice that there are much fewer dots in these scatterplots compared to the scatterplots we saw earlier. This is due to the `freq` setting: we specified that only 10 percent of the cases with missing values should have missingness pattern 4. Second, the scatterplots show that all the amputed data are at the left hand side of the weighted sum scores due to the `"LEFT"` setting in the `type` argument. Third, these figures show that there is a perfect relation between variable V2 and the weighted sum scores. Clearly, pattern 4 depends on variable V2 only, which we can remember from the `weights` matrix we used.   

```{r}
result$weights
```

### `cont == FALSE`

When argument `cont` is set to `FALSE`, we use argument `odds` to define the probability values manually. The specification of odds values occurs in two steps. First, we divide each subset into a certain number of equally sized groups. The number of groups can differ between patterns. Second, for each group within a pattern, an odds value defines the relative probability of having missing values. 

Let us have a look at the working of these odds values. The default `odds` matrix is as follows:  

```{r}
myodds <- result$odds
myodds
```

This `odds` matrix specifies that the candidates of each pattern are divided into four groups, since each pattern (each row) consists of four values. Furthermore, the values `c(1, 2, 3, 4)` indicate that a case with a weighted sum score in the highest quantile will have a probability of having missing values that is four times higher than a candidate with a weighted sum score in the lowest quantile. In Figure 4 the different probabilities that belong to this setting are shown for 100 candidates of pattern 1. 

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5, echo = FALSE}
len <- length(result$scores[[1]])
R <- sample(x = c(1, 0), size = len, 
            prob = c(100 / len, (len - 100) / len), replace = TRUE)
data3 <- matrix(NA, length(R[R == 1]), 3)
data3[, 1] <- result$scores[[1]][R == 1]
ng <- length(result$odds[1, ][!is.na(result$odds[1, ])])
quantiles <- quantile(data3[, 1], probs = seq(0, 1, by = 1 / ng))
Q <- rep(NA, length(data3[, 1]))
for (k in 1:ng) {
  Q <- replace(Q, data3[, 1] >= quantiles[k] 
               & data3[, 1] <= quantiles[k + 1], k)
}
data3[, 2] <- Q
for (l in 1:ng) {
data3[data3[, 2] == l, 3] <- (ng * result$prop * result$odds[1, l]) / 
  sum(result$odds[1, ], na.rm = TRUE)
}
data3 <- as.data.frame(data3)
names(data3) <- c("scores", "group", "prob")
plot2 <- xyplot(prob ~ scores, data = data3, groups = group,
                ylab = "Probability", xlab = "Standardized weighted sum scores",
                pch=c(1,2,3,4), 
                cex = 0.5, col = rep("black", 4),
                key=list(space="top", columns=4, title="", 
                         cex = 1, points = list(pch = c(1, 2, 3, 4)), 
                         text = list(c("Group1", "Group2", "Group3", "Group4"))))
dat <- result$data[result$cand == 1, "V2"]
data3["V2"] <-  dat[R == 1]
dat <- result$data[result$cand == 1, "V3"]
data3["V3"] <-  dat[R == 1]
plot3 <- xyplot(V3 ~ V2, data = data3, groups = group,
                ylab = "Variable V3", xlab = "Variable V2", 
                pch=c(1,2,3,4), 
                cex = 0.8, col = rep("black", 4),
                key=list(space="top", columns=4, title="", 
                         cex = 1, points = list(pch = c(1, 2, 3, 4)), 
                         text = list(c("Group1", "Group2", "Group3", "Group4"))))
plot2
```

As can be seen, there are indeed four groups in pattern 1. The groups have an approximately equal size, with each a certain probability to obtain missing values. The probability of group 4 is indeed four times as large as the probability of group 1. 

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5, echo = FALSE}
plot3

Figure 5 shows the relation between the groups and the variable values. Because the relationship between variable V2 and the weighted sum scores is high (due to the `weights` matrix), the groups can be distinguished very well. Besides, for higher values of V2, the weighted sum scores are higher. These are the cases that are placed in group 4. Therefore, they are at the right hand side of the V2 scale. For variable V3, the relation between the values and the group allocation is small. This, again, is due to the `weights` setting. Still, because of the odds values, group 4 is much more to the right of the V3 scale than group 1, 2 and 3. 

Let us now dig deeper into the contents of the `odds` matrix. The #rows of this matrix are equal to #patterns. The #columns are defined by the user and depend on the desired amputation procedure. The cells in the `odds` matrix that are not used should be filled with NAs. Let us define the following matrix: 

```{r}
myodds[3, ] <- c(1, 0, 0, 1)
myodds[4, ] <- c(1, 1, 2, 2)
myodds <- cbind(myodds, matrix(c(NA, NA, NA, 1, NA, NA, NA, 1), nrow = 4, byrow = F))
myodds
```

We keep the default setting of the first two patterns. Then, for pattern 3, the weighted sum scores will be divided into four groups. The odds values mean that candidates with low weighted sum scores will have a probability to be missing that is equal to the probability of candidates with high weighted sum scores. However, candidates with weighted sum scores around average will not be made missing. Because pattern 3 depends on variable V1 with a weight of 3 and on variable V2 with a weight of 1, the effect will be most visible for variable V1. 

The weighted sum scores of the fourth pattern will be divided into six groups. All candidates will have a probability of having missing values, but this probability is larger for candidates with weighted sum scores around average. 

```{r}
result <- ampute(testdata, freq = c(0.7, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1), patterns = mypatterns, 
                 weights = myweights,cont = FALSE, odds = myodds, prop = 0.3)
```

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
bwplot(result, which.pat = c(3, 4), descriptives = FALSE)
```

In the boxplots of pattern 3, it is visible that the IQR for the amputed data is larger than for the non-amputed data. This is especially the case for variable V1, a bit less for variable V2 and almost absent for variable V3.

In pattern 4, the effect of the specifications is only visible for variable V2, because the other variables are made missing. In contrast to pattern 3, the amputation is performed in the center of the weighted sum scores, resulting to a MID-like missingness pattern.

### 3. Additional features of `ampute` 

`ampute` contains the functions `bwplot` and `xyplot` to investigate the behaviour of the missingness. As discussed, `ampute` can generate MCAR, MAR and MNAR missingness. A combination of MAR and MNAR missingness can be generated by changing the `weights` matrix. The following command, for instance, generates MAR missingness in pattern 1 and MNAR missingness in pattern 2. As a result, the incomplete dataset will contain both type of missingness mechanisms. 

```{r}
result <- ampute(testdata, freq = c(0.7, 0.3), patterns = c(0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0), weights = c(0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1))
```

Unfortunately, the generation of both MCAR and MAR (or any form of weak MAR missingness) is not yet directly possible. By running the function twice, however, the desired combination of mechanisms can still be obtained. For example: 

```{r}
ampdata1 <- ampute(testdata, patterns = c(0, 1, 1), prop = 0.2, mech = "MAR")$amp
ampdata2 <- ampute(testdata, patterns = c(1, 1, 0), prop = 0.8, mech = "MCAR")$amp

indices <- sample(x = c(1, 2), size = nrow(testdata), replace = TRUE, 
                  prob = c(1/2, 1/2))

ampdata <- matrix(NA, nrow = nrow(testdata), ncol = ncol(testdata))
ampdata[indices == 1, ] <- as.matrix(ampdata1[indices == 1, ])
ampdata[indices == 2, ] <- as.matrix(ampdata2[indices == 2, ])

md.pattern(ampdata)
```

##### Class `mads`

The return object from `ampute` is of class `mads`. `mads` contains the amputed dataset, the function specifications and some extra objects that might be useful.

```{r}
names(result)
```

The object `cand` is a vector that contains for every case the missing data pattern it was candidate for. 

```{r}
result$cand[1:30]
```

The object `scores` is a list with, for each pattern, the weighted sum scores of the candidates. 

```{r}
result$scores[[1]][1:10]
```

Furthermore, the object `data` contains the original data. 

```{r}
head(result$data)
```

##### Argument `run`

For large datasets or slow computers, it might be desirable to specify the needed matrices before performing the amputation right away. When the argument `run` is set to `FALSE`, all results will be stored in the `mads` object except for the amputed dataset. As a result, the default settings for the `patterns`, `weights` or `odds` argument can be changed easily and entered into a new run (with `run == TRUE`).

```{r}
emptyresult <- ampute(testdata, run = FALSE)
emptyresult$amp
```

## Go ahead and `ampute`!
