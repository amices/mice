\title{Scan variable types in new data and compare to trained models}
\usage{
scan.types(data, models, coerce = FALSE, print = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame with new data to be filled}

\item{models}{A list of trained model objects as produced by \code{mice()}}

\item{coerce}{Logical, if TRUE attempt to coerce variables in \code{data} to match \code{models}}

\item{print}{Logical, if TRUE prints the resulting table.}
}
\value{
A data frame with one row per variable, and diagnostic columns. If \code{coerce = TRUE},
the result has an attribute \code{"data"} with the coerced data.
}
\description{
This function scans the variables in \code{data} and compares their types and structure
against the trained models. If \code{coerce = TRUE}, variables in \code{data} will be
coerced to match the type information in \code{models}, and the scan is rerun on the
coerced data. The modified data is attached as an attribute \code{"data"} to the result.
