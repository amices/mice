\title{Compare two nested models fitted to imputed data}
\usage{
pool.compare(fit1, fit0, data = NULL, method = "Wald")
}
\arguments{
\item{fit1}{An object of class 'mira', produced by \code{with.mids()}.}

\item{fit0}{An object of class 'mira', produced by \code{with.mids()}. The
model in \code{fit0} should be a submodel of \code{fit1}. Moreover, the
variables of the submodel should be the first variables of the larger model
and in the same order as in the submodel.}

\item{data}{In case of method 'likelihood' it is necessary to pass also the
original \code{mids} object to the \code{data} argument. Default value is
\code{NULL}, in case of method='Wald'.}

\item{method}{A string describing the method to compare the two models.  Two
kind of comparisons are included so far: 'Wald' and 'likelihood'.}
}
\value{
A list containing several components. Component \code{call} is
that call to the \code{pool.compare} function. Component \code{call11} is
the call that created \code{fit1}. Component \code{call12} is the 
call that created the imputations. Component \code{call01} is the 
call that created \code{fit0}. Compenent \code{call02} is the 
call that created the imputations. Components \code{method} is the 
method used to compare two models: 'Wald' or 'likelihood'. Component
\code{nmis} is the number of missing entries for each variable.
Component \code{m} is the number of imputations. 
Component \code{qhat1} is a matrix, containing the estimated coeffients of the
\emph{m} repeated complete data analyses from \code{fit1}. 
Component \code{qhat0} is a matrix, containing the estimated coeffients of the
\emph{m} repeated complete data analyses from \code{fit0}.
Component \code{ubar1} is the mean of the variances of \code{fit1}, 
formula (3.1.3), Rubin (1987).
Component \code{ubar0} is the mean of the variances of \code{fit0}, 
formula (3.1.3), Rubin (1987).
Component \code{qbar1} is the pooled estimate of \code{fit1}, formula (3.1.2) Rubin
(1987).
Component \code{qbar0} is the pooled estimate of \code{fit0}, formula (3.1.2) Rubin
(1987).
Component \code{Dm} is the test statistic.
Component \code{rm} is the relative increase in variance due to nonresponse, formula
(3.1.7), Rubin (1987).
Component \code{df1}: df1 = under the null hypothesis it is assumed that \code{Dm} has an F
distribution with (df1,df2) degrees of freedom.
Component \code{df2}: df2. 
Component \code{pvalue} is the P-value of testing whether the larger model is
statistically different from the smaller submodel.

\description{
Compares two nested models after m repeated complete data analysis
}
\details{
The function is based on the article of Meng and Rubin (1992). The
Wald-method can be found in paragraph 2.2 and the likelihood method can be
found in paragraph 3.  One could use the Wald method for comparison of linear
models obtained with e.g. \code{lm} (in \code{with.mids()}).  The likelihood
method should be used in case of logistic regression models obtaind with
\code{glm()} in \code{with.mids()}.  It is assumed that fit1 contains the
larger model and the model in \code{fit0} is fully contained in \code{fit1}.
In case of \code{method='Wald'}, the null hypothesis is tested that the extra
parameters are all zero.

\examples{

### To compare two linear models:
imp <- mice(nhanes2)
mi1 <- with(data=imp, expr=lm(bmi~age+hyp+chl))
mi0 <- with(data=imp, expr=lm(bmi~age+hyp))
pc  <- pool.compare(mi1, mi0, method='Wald')
pc$spvalue
#            [,1]
#[1,] 0.000293631
#

### Comparison of two general linear models (logistic regression).
\dontrun{
imp  <- mice(boys, maxit=2)
fit0 <- with(imp, glm(gen>levels(gen)[1] ~ hgt+hc,family=binomial))
fit1 <- with(imp, glm(gen>levels(gen)[1] ~ hgt+hc+reg,family=binomial))
pool.compare(fit1, fit0, method='likelihood', data=imp)}
