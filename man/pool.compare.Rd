\title{Compare two nested models fitted to imputed data}
\usage{
pool.compare(fit1, fit0, method = c("wald", "likelihood"), data = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit1}{An object of class 'mira', produced by `with.mids()`.}

\item{fit0}{An object of class 'mira', produced by `with.mids()`. The
model in `fit0` is a nested fit0 of `fit1`.}

\item{method}{Either `"wald"` or `"likelihood"` specifying
the type of comparison. The default is `"wald"`.}

\item{data}{No longer used.}
}
\value{
A list containing several components. Component `call` is
the call to the `pool.compare` function. Component `call11` is
the call that created `fit1`. Component `call12` is the
call that created the imputations. Component `call01` is the
call that created `fit0`. Component `call02` is the
call that created the imputations. Components `method` is the
method used to compare two models: 'Wald' or 'likelihood'. Component
`nmis` is the number of missing entries for each variable.
Component `m` is the number of imputations.
Component `qhat1` is a matrix, containing the estimated coefficients of the
*m* repeated complete data analyses from `fit1`.
Component `qhat0` is a matrix, containing the estimated coefficients of the
*m* repeated complete data analyses from `fit0`.
Component `ubar1` is the mean of the variances of `fit1`,
formula (3.1.3), Rubin (1987).
Component `ubar0` is the mean of the variances of `fit0`,
formula (3.1.3), Rubin (1987).
Component `qbar1` is the pooled estimate of `fit1`, formula (3.1.2) Rubin
(1987).
Component `qbar0` is the pooled estimate of `fit0`, formula (3.1.2) Rubin
(1987).
Component `Dm` is the test statistic.
Component `rm` is the relative increase in variance due to nonresponse, formula
(3.1.7), Rubin (1987).
Component `df1`: df1 = under the null hypothesis it is assumed that `Dm` has an F
distribution with (df1,df2) degrees of freedom.
Component `df2`: df2.
Component `pvalue` is the P-value of testing whether the model `fit1` is
statistically different from the smaller `fit0`.

\details{
Compares two nested models after m repeated complete data analysis

The function is based on the article of Meng and Rubin (1992). The
Wald-method can be found in paragraph 2.2 and the likelihood method can be
found in paragraph 3.  One could use the Wald method for comparison of linear
models obtained with e.g. `lm` (in `with.mids()`).  The likelihood
method should be used in case of logistic regression models obtained with
`glm()` in `with.mids()`.

The function assumes that `fit1` is the
larger model, and that model `fit0` is fully contained in `fit1`.
In case of `method='wald'`, the null hypothesis is tested that the extra
parameters are all zero.
