\title{Multivariate Amputed Data Set (\code{mads})}
\description{
The \code{mads} object contains an amputed data set. The \code{mads} object is
generated by the \code{ampute} function. The \code{mads} class of objects has 
methods for the following generic functions: \code{print}, \code{summary}, 
\code{bwplot}and \code{xyplot}.
}
\note{
Many of the functions of the \code{mice} package do not use the S4 class 
definitions, and instead rely on the S3 list equivalent 
\code{oldClass(obj) <- "mads"}.
}
\section{Contents}{

\describe{
\item{\code{call}:}{The function call.}
\item{\code{prop}:}{Proportion of cases with missing values. Note: even when
the proportion is entered as the proportion of missing cells (when 
\code{bycases == TRUE}), this object contains the proportion of missing cases.}
\item{\code{patterns}:}{A data frame of size #patterns by #variables where \code{0} 
indicates a variable has missing values and \code{1} indicates a variable remains 
complete.}
\item{\code{freq}:}{A vector of length #patterns containing the relative 
frequency with which the patterns occur. For example, if the vector is 
\code{c(0.4, 0.4, 0.2)}, this means that of all cases with missing values, 
40 percent is candidate for pattern 1, 40 percent for pattern 2 and 20 
percent for pattern 3. The vector sums to 1.}
\item{\code{mech}:}{A string specifying the missingness mechanism, either 
\code{"MCAR"}, \code{"MAR"} or \code{"MNAR"}.}
\item{\code{weights}:}{A data frame of size #patterns by #variables. It contains 
the weights that were used to calculate the weighted sum scores. The weights 
may differ between patterns and between variables.}
\item{\code{cont}:}{Logical, whether probabilities are based on continuous logit
functions or on discrete odds distributions.}
\item{\code{type}:}{A vector of strings containing the type of missingness 
for each pattern. Either \code{"LEFT"}, \code{"MID"}, \code{"TAIL"} or 
\code{"RIGHT"}. The first type refers to the first pattern, the second type
to the second pattern, etc.} 
\item{\code{odds}:}{A matrix where #patterns defines the #rows. Each row contains 
the odds of being missing for the corresponding pattern. The amount of odds values 
defines in how many quantiles the sum scores were divided. The values are 
relative probabilities: a quantile with odds value 4 will have a probability of 
being missing that is four times higher than a quantile with odds 1. The 
#quantiles may differ between patterns, NA is used for cells remaining empty.}
\item{\code{amp}:}{A data frame containing the input data with NAs for the 
amputed values.}
\item{\code{cand}:}{A vector that contains the pattern number for each case. 
A value between 1 and #patterns is given. For example, a case with value 2 is 
candidate for missing data pattern 2.}
\item{\code{scores}:}{A list containing vectors with weighted sum scores of the 
candidates. The first vector refers to the candidates of the first pattern, the
second vector refers to the candidates of the second pattern, etc. The length
of the vectors differ because the number of candidates is different for each 
pattern.}
\item{\code{data}:}{The complete data set that was entered in \code{ampute}.}
