\title{Name imputation blocks}
\usage{
name.blocks(blocks, prefix = "B")
}
\arguments{
\item{blocks}{List of vectors with variable names per block. List elements
may be named to identify blocks. Variables within a block are
imputed by a multivariate imputation method
(see \code{method} argument). By default each variable is placed
into its own block, which is effectively
fully conditional specification (FCS) by univariate models
(variable-by-variable imputation). Only variables whose names appear in
\code{blocks} are imputed. The relevant columns in the \code{where}
matrix are set to \code{FALSE} of variables that are not block members.
A variable may appear in multiple blocks. In that case, it is
effectively re-imputed each time that it is visited.}

\item{prefix}{A character vector of length 1 with the prefix to
be using for naming any unnamed blocks with two or more variables.}
}
\value{
A named list of character vectors with variables names.
}
\description{
This helper function names any unnamed elements in the \code{blocks}
specification. This is a convenience function.
}
\details{
This function will name any unnamed list elements specified in
the optional argument \code{blocks}. Unnamed blocks
consisting of just one variable will be named after this variable.
Unnamed blocks containing more than one variables will be named
by the \code{prefix} argument, padded by an integer sequence
stating at 1.

blocks <- list(c("hyp", "chl"), AGE = "age", c("bmi", "hyp"), "edu")
