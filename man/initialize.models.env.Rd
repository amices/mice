\title{Initialize Models Environment}
\usage{
initialize.models.env(models = NULL, tasks, m)
}
\arguments{
\item{models}{An existing environment to store models. If \code{NULL}, a
new environment is created.}

\item{tasks}{A named character vector where names are variable names and
values specify task types. Only variables labeled \code{"train"} will have
nested environments created.}

\item{m}{An integer specifying the number of nested sub-environments to
create under each \code{"train"} variable.}
}
\value{
An environment containing model environments structured as:
\itemize{
\item \code{models$varname} - An environment for each \code{"train"} variable.
\item \code{models$varname$i} - Nested environments for each iteration from \code{1} to \code{m}.
}
}
\description{
Creates an environment structure for models based on specified task types.
It ensures that a nested environment is created for each variable in \code{tasks}
that is labeled as \code{"train"}, with sub-environments for each iteration
from \code{1} to \code{m}.
}
\examples{
tasks <- c(a = "train", b = "fill", c = "train", d = "other")
m <- 3
models_env <- mice:::initialize.models.env(tasks = tasks, m = m)
ls(models_env)  # Lists "a" and "c" (only "train" tasks)
ls(models_env$a)  # Lists "1", "2", "3"
ls(models_env$c)  # Lists "1", "2", "3"
}
