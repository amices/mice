\title{Multiply imputed repeated analyses (\code{mira})}
\description{
The \code{mira} object is generated by the \code{with.mids()} function.
The \code{as.mira()}
function takes the results of repeated complete-data analysis stored as a
list, and turns it into a \code{mira} object that can be pooled.
}
\details{
In versions prior to \code{mice 3.0} pooling required only that
\code{coef()} and \code{vcov()} methods were available for fitted
objects. \emph{This feature is no longer supported}. The reason is that \code{vcov()}
methods are inconsistent across packages, leading to buggy behaviour
of the \code{pool()} function. Since \code{mice 3.0+}, the \code{broom}
package takes care of filtering out the relevant parts of the
complete-data analysis. It may happen that you'll see the messages
like \code{No method for tidying an S3 object of class ...} or
\code{Error: No glance method for objects of class ...}. The royal
way to solve this problem is to write your own \code{glance()} and \code{tidy()}
methods and add these to \code{broom} according to the specifications
given in \url{https://broom.tidymodels.org}.

The \code{mira} class of objects has methods for the
following generic functions: \code{print}, \code{summary}.

Many of the functions of the \code{mice} package do not use the
S4 class definitions, and instead rely on the S3 list equivalent
\code{oldClass(obj) <- "mira"}.
