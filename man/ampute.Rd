\usage{
ampute(data, prop = 0.5, patterns = NULL, freq = NULL, mech = "MAR",
  weights = NULL, cont = TRUE, type = NULL, odds = NULL,
  bycases = TRUE, run = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A complete data matrix or dataframe. Values should be numeric. 
Categorical variables should have been transformed into dummies.}

\item{prop}{A scalar specifying the proportion of missingness. Should be a value 
between 0 and 1. Default is a missingness proportion of 0.5.}

\item{patterns}{A matrix or data frame of size #patterns by #variables where 
\code{0} indicates a variable should have missing values and \code{1} indicates 
a variable should remain complete. The user may specify as many patterns as 
desired. One pattern (a vector) or double patterns are possible as well. Default 
is a square matrix of size #variables where each pattern has missingness on one 
variable only (created with \code{\link{ampute.default.patterns}}). After the 
amputation procedure, \code{\link{md.pattern}} can be used to investigate the 
missing data patterns in the data.}

\item{freq}{A vector of length #patterns containing the relative frequency with 
which the patterns should occur. For example, for three missing data patterns, 
the vector could be \code{c(0.4, 0.4, 0.2)}, meaning that of all cases with 
missing values, 40 percent should have pattern 1, 40 percent pattern 2 and 20 
percent pattern 3. The vector should sum to 1. Default is an equal probability 
for each pattern, created with \code{\link{ampute.default.freq}}.}

\item{mech}{A string specifying the missingness mechanism, either MCAR 
(Missing Completely At Random), MAR (Missing At Random) or MNAR (Missing Not At 
Random). Default is a MAR missingness mechanism.}

\item{weights}{A matrix or data frame of size #patterns by #variables. The matrix 
contains the weights that will be used to calculate the weighted sum scores. For 
a MAR mechanism, weights of the variables that will be made incomplete, should be 
zero. For a MNAR mechanism, these weights might have any possible value. Furthermore, 
the weights may differ between patterns and between variables. They may be negative 
as well. Within each pattern, the relative size of the values are of importance. 
The default weights matrix is made with \code{\link{ampute.default.weights}} and 
returns a matrix with equal weights for all variables. In case of MAR, variables 
that will be amputed will be weighted with \code{0}. If it is MNAR, variables 
that will be observed will be weighted with \code{0}. If mechanism is MCAR, the 
weights matrix will not be used.}

\item{cont}{Logical. Whether the probabilities should be based on a continuous 
or discrete distribution. If TRUE, the probabilities of being missing are based 
on a continuous logistic distribution function. \code{\link{ampute.continuous}} 
will be used to calculate and assign the probabilities. These will be based on 
argument \code{type}. If FALSE, the probabilities of being missing are based on 
a discrete distribution (\code{\link{ampute.discrete}}) based on the \code{odds} 
argument. 
Default is TRUE.}

\item{type}{A vector of strings containing the type of missingness for each 
pattern. Either \code{"LEFT"}, \code{"MID"}, \code{"TAIL"} or '\code{"RIGHT"}. 
If a single missingness type is entered, all patterns will be created by the same 
type. If missingness types should differ over patterns, a vector of missingness 
types should be entered. Default is RIGHT for all patterns and is the result of
\code{\link{ampute.default.type}}.}

\item{odds}{A matrix where #patterns defines the #rows. Each row should contain 
the odds of being missing for the corresponding pattern. The amount of odds values 
defines in how many quantiles the sum scores will be divided. The values are 
relative probabilities: a quantile with odds value 4 will have a probability of 
being missing that is four times higher than a quantile with odds 1. The 
#quantiles may differ between the patterns, specify NA for cells remaining empty. 
Default is 4 quantiles with odds values 1, 2, 3 and 4, the result of 
\code{\link{ampute.default.odds}}.}

\item{bycases}{Logical. If TRUE, the proportion of missingness is defined in 
terms of cases. If FALSE, the proportion of missingness is defined in terms of 
cells. Default is TRUE.}

\item{run}{Logical. If TRUE, the amputations are implemented. If FALSE, the 
return object will contain everything but the amputed data set.}

\description{
This function generates multivariate missing data in a MCAR, MAR or MNAR manner. 
Imputation of data sets containing missing values can be performed with 
\code{\link{mice}}.
}
\details{
When new multiple imputation techniques are tested, missing values need to be
generated in simulated data sets. The generation of missing values is what
we call: amputation. The function \code{ampute} is developed to perform any kind
of amputation desired by the researcher. An extensive example and more explanation
of the function can be found in the vignette \emph{Generate missing values with 
ampute}, available in \pkg{mice} as well. For imputation, the function 
\code{\link{mice}} is advised.

Until recently, univariate amputation procedures were used to generate missing
data in complete, simulated data sets. With this approach, variables are made
incomplete one variable at a time. When several variables need to be amputed, 
the procedure is repeated multiple times.

With this univariate approach, it is difficult to relate the missingness on one 
variable to the missingness on another variable. A multivariate amputation procedure 
solves this issue and moreover, it does justice to the multivariate nature of 
data sets. Hence, \code{ampute} is developed to perform the amputation according 
the researcher's desires.

The idea behind the function is the specification of several missingness 
patterns. Each pattern is a combination of variables with and without missing 
values (denoted by \code{0} and \code{1} respectively). For example, one might
want to create two missingness patterns on a data set with four variables. The
patterns could be something like: \code{0, 0, 1, 1} and \code{1, 0, 1, 0}. 
Each combination of zeros and ones may occur.

Furthermore, the researcher specifies the proportion of missingness, either the 
proportion of missing cases or the proportion of missing cells, and the relative 
frequency each pattern occurs. Consequently, the data is divided over the 
patterns with these probabilities. Now, each case is candidate for a certain 
missingness pattern, but whether the case will have missing values eventually, 
depends on other specifications.

The first of these specifications is the missing mechanism. There are three possible 
mechanisms: the missingness depends completely on chance (MCAR), the missingness 
depends on the values of the observed variables (i.e. the variables that remain
complete) (MAR) or on the values of the variables that will be made incomplete (MNAR). 
For a more thorough explanation of these definitions, I refer to Van Buuren 
(2012).

When the user sets the missingness mechanism to \code{"MCAR"}, the candidates 
have an equal probability of having missing values. No other specifications 
have to be made. For a \code{"MAR"} or \code{"MNAR"} mechanism, weighted sum 
scores are calculated. These scores are a linear combination of the 
variables.

In order to calculate the weighted sum scores, the data is standardized. That 
is the reason the data has to be numeric. Second, for each case, the values in 
the data set are multiplied with the weights, specified by argument \code{weights}. 
These weighted scores will be summed, resulting in a weighted sum score for each case.

The weights may differ between patterns and they may be negative or zero as well.
Naturally, in case of a \code{MAR} mechanism, the weights corresponding to the 
variables that will be made incomplete, have a \code{0}. Note that this might be
different for each pattern. In case of \code{MNAR} missingness, especially
the weights of the variables that will be made incomplete are of importance. However,
the other variables might be weighted as well. 
 
It is the relative difference between the weights that will result in an effect 
in the sum scores. For example, for the first missing data
pattern mentioned above, the weights for the third and fourth variables might
be set to 2 and 4. However, weight values of 0.2 and 0.4 will have the exact
same effect on the weighted sum score: the fourth variable is weighted twice as
much as variable 3.

Based on the weighted sum scores, either a discrete or continuous distribution 
of probabilities is used to calculate whether a candidate will have missing values.

For a discrete distribution of probabilities, the weighted sum scores are 
divided into subgroups of equal size (quantiles). Thereafter, the user 
specifies for each subgroup the odds of being missing. Both the number of 
subgroups and the odds values are important for the generation of missing data. 
For example, for a RIGHT-like mechanism, scoring in one of the 
higher quantiles should have high missingness odds, whereas for a MID-like 
mechanism, the central groups should have higher odds. Again, not the size of 
the odds values are of importance, but the relative distance between the values.

The continuous distributions of probabilities are based on the logit function, as 
described by Van Buuren (2012). The user can specify the type of missingness, 
which, again, may differ between patterns.

For an extensive example of the working of the function, I gladly refer to the 
vignette \emph{Generate missing values with ampute}.
