\description{
Data from Potthoff-Roy (1964) with repeated measures on dental fissures.
}
\details{
This data set is the famous Potthoff-Roy data, used to demonstrate MANOVA on
repeated measure data. Potthoff and Roy (1964) published classic data on a
study in 16 boys and 11 girls, who at ages 8, 10, 12, and 14 had the distance
(mm) from the center of the pituitary gland to the pteryomaxillary fissure
measured. Changes in pituitary-pteryomaxillary distances during growth is
important in orthodontic therapy. The goals of the study were to describe the
distance in boys and girls as simple functions of age, and then to compare
the functions for boys and girls. The data have been reanalyzed by many
authors including Jennrich and Schluchter (1986), Little and Rubin (1987),
Pinheiro and Bates (2000), Verbeke and Molenberghs (2000) and Molenberghs and
Kenward (2007). See Chapter 9 of Van Buuren (2012) for a challenging
exercise using these data.
