\usage{
\method{bwplot}{mads}(x, data, which.pat = NULL, standardized = TRUE,
  descriptives = TRUE, layout = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{mads} (\code{\link{mads-class}}) object, typically created by 
\code{\link{ampute}}.}

\item{data}{A string or vector of variable names that needs to be plotted. As 
a default, all variables will be plotted.}

\item{which.pat}{A scalar or vector indicating which patterns need to be plotted. 
As a default, all patterns are plotted.}

\item{standardized}{Logical. Whether the box-and-whisker plots need to be created
from standardized data or not. Default is TRUE.}

\item{descriptives}{Logical. Whether the mean, variance and n of the variables
need to be printed. This is useful to examine the effect of the amputation. 
Default is TRUE.}

\item{layout}{A vector of two values indicating how the boxplots of one pattern
should be divided over the plot. For example, \code{c(2, 3)} indicates that the 
boxplots of six variables need to be placed on 3 rows and 2 columns. Default
is 1 row and an amount of columns equal to #variables. Note that for more than 
6 variables, multiple plots will be created automatically.}

\item{\dots}{Not used, but for consistency with generic}
}
\value{
A list containing the box-and-whisker plots. Note that a new pattern 
will always be shown in a new plot.
}
\description{
Plotting method to investigate the result of function \code{\link{ampute}}. 
the relation between the data variables and the amputed data. The function does 
not show which data is amputed. It does show how the amputed values are related 
to the variable values.
}
\note{
The \code{mads} object contains all the information you need to 
make any desired plots. Check \code{\link{mads-class}} or the vignette \emph{Multivariate 
Amputation using Ampute} to understand the contents of class object \code{mads}.
