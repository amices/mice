Amputation complete data sets useful evaluation imputation techniques, multiple imputation (performed function mice package). basic strategy underlying multivariate imputation suggested Don Rubin discussions 90's. Brand (1997) created one particular implementation, method found way FCS paper (Van Buuren et al, 2006). recently, univariate amputation procedures used generate missing data complete, simulated data sets. approach, variables made incomplete one variable time. one variable needs amputed, procedure repeated multiple times. univariate approach, difficult relate missingness one variable missingness another variable. multivariate amputation procedure solves issue moreover, justice multivariate nature data sets. Hence, ampute developed perform multivariate amputation. idea behind function specification several missingness patterns. pattern combination variables without missing values (denoted 0 1 respectively). example, one might want create two missingness patterns data set four variables. patterns something like: 0,0,1,1 1,0,1,0. combination zeros ones may occur. Furthermore, researcher specifies proportion missingness, either proportion missing cases proportion missing cells, relative frequency pattern occurs. Consequently, data split multiple subsets, one subset per pattern. Now, case candidate certain missingness pattern, whether case missing values eventually depends specifications. first specifications missing mechanism. three possible mechanisms: missingness depends completely chance (MCAR), missingness depends values observed variables (.e. variables remain complete) (MAR) values variables made incomplete (MNAR). user specifies missingness mechanism \"MCAR\", candidates equal probability becoming incomplete. \"MAR\" \"MNAR\" mechanism, weighted sum scores calculated. scores linear combination variables. order calculate weighted sum scores, data standardized. reason, data numeric. Second, case, values data set multiplied weights, specified argument weights. weighted scores summed, resulting weighted sum score case. weights may differ patterns may negative zero well. Naturally, case MAR mechanism, weights corresponding variables made incomplete, 0. Note may different pattern. case MNAR missingness, especially weights variables made incomplete importance. However, variables may weighted well. relative difference weights result effect sum scores. example, first missing data pattern mentioned , weights third fourth variables set 2 4. However, weight values 0.2 0.4 exact effect weighted sum score: fourth variable weighted twice much variable 3. Based weighted sum scores, either discrete continuous distribution probabilities used calculate whether candidate missing values. discrete distribution probabilities, weighted sum scores divided subgroups equal size (quantiles). Thereafter, user specifies subgroup odds missing. number subgroups odds values important generation missing data. example, RIGHT-like mechanism, scoring one higher quantiles high missingness odds, whereas MID-like mechanism, central groups higher odds. , size odds values importance, relative distance values. continuous distributions probabilities based logistic distribution function. user can specify type missingness, , , may differ patterns. example explanation arguments interact , refer vignette: Generate missing values ampute.","code":""},{"path":"https://amices.org/mice/dev/reference/ampute.html","id":"references","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"References","title":"Generate missing data for simulation purposes — ampute","text":"Brand, J.P.L.
